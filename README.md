# Marktplaats parser with filters
DEMO: [http://ponify.nl/mp/test-1.html](http://ponify.nl/mp/test-1.html)

Marktplaats has a limited category overview which displays 25 ad's max and does not allow filtering. This simple python crawler attempts to fix that by parsing and filtering the marktplaats category pages. It also creates a, IMHO more usable overview without all the nonsense. Furthermore it caches advertisements offline, so this can be run locally and is still usable when an internet connection is not available.
